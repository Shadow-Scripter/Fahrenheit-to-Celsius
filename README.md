# Hey! In here, ill walk you through how to use the Temp's!

First, if your in repl.it, then head to Shell. Beside the console.
Then type in 'g++ main.cpp'. After that, a file names a.out will be made. Dont hesitate, we dont need anything in there. In Shell, type './a.out'. After, you will be started! 

# If you want to run the program again, just redo the process.
